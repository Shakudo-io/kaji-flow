            <p>Think about autonomous driving. When a human has to take over the wheel, that's not a feature - it's a failure of the system. The car couldn't handle the situation on its own.</p>

            <h3>Why is coding any different?</h3>

            <p>When you find yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixing the AI's half-finished code</li>
                <li>Manually correcting obvious mistakes</li>
                <li>Guiding the agent step-by-step through a task</li>
                <li>Repeatedly clarifying the same requirements</li>
            </ul>

            <p>...that's not "human-AI collaboration." That's the AI failing to do its job.</p>

            <p><strong>Oh My OpenCode is built on this premise</strong>: Human intervention during agentic work is fundamentally a wrong signal. If the system is designed correctly, the agent should complete the work without requiring you to babysit it.</p>

            <p class="highlight-box"><strong>Goal: Code written by the agent should be indistinguishable from code written by a senior engineer.</strong></p>

            <p>Not "AI-generated code that needs cleanup." Not "a good starting point." The actual, final, production-ready code.</p>

            <p>This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Following existing codebase patterns exactly</li>
                <li>Proper error handling without being asked</li>
                <li>Tests that actually test the right things</li>
                <li>No AI slop (over-engineering, unnecessary abstractions, scope creep)</li>
                <li>Comments only when they add value</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you can tell whether a commit was made by a human or an agent, the agent has failed.</p>

        <section id="token-cost">
            <h2>Token Cost vs. Productivity</h2>

            <p><strong>Higher token usage is acceptable if it significantly increases productivity.</strong></p>

            <p>Using more tokens to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have multiple specialized agents research in parallel</li>
                <li>Get the job done completely without human intervention</li>
                <li>Verify work thoroughly before completion</li>
                <li>Accumulate knowledge across tasks</li>
            </ul>

            <p>...is a worthwhile investment when it means 10x, 20x, or 100x productivity gains.</p>

            <h3>However:</h3>

            <p>Unnecessary token waste is not pursued. The system optimizes for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using cheaper models (Haiku, Flash) for simple tasks</li>
                <li>Avoiding redundant exploration</li>
                <li>Caching learnings across sessions</li>
                <li>Stopping research when sufficient context is gathered</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Token efficiency matters. But not at the cost of work quality or human cognitive load.</p>

            <h2>Minimize Human Cognitive Load</h2>

            <p><strong>The human should only need to say what they want. Everything else is the agent's job.</strong></p>

            <p>Two approaches to achieve this:</p>

            <div class="approach-container">
                <div class="approach">
                    <h3>Approach 1: Prometheus (Interview Mode)</h3>
                    <p>You say: "I want to add authentication."</p>
                    <p>Prometheus:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Researches your codebase to understand existing patterns</li>
                        <li>Asks clarifying questions based on actual findings</li>
                        <li>Surfaces edge cases you hadn't considered</li>
                        <li>Documents decisions as you make them</li>
                        <li>Generates a complete work plan</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>You provide intent. The agent provides structure.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div class="approach">
                    <h3>Approach 2: Ultrawork (Just Do It Mode)</h3>
                    <p>You say: "ulw add authentication"</p>
                    <p>The agent:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Figures out the right approach</li>
                        <li>Researches best practices</li>
                        <li>Implements following conventions</li>
                        <li>Verifies everything works</li>
                        <li>Keeps going until complete</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>You provide intent. The agent handles everything.</strong></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>In both cases, the human's job is to <strong>express what they want</strong>, not to manage how it gets done.</p>

        <section id="predictable-continuous">
            <h2>Predictable, Continuous, Delegatable</h2>

            <p><strong>The ideal agent should work like a compiler</strong>: markdown document goes in, working code comes out.</p>

            <h3>Predictable</h3>
            <p>Given the same inputs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Same codebase patterns</li>
                <li>Same requirements</li>
                <li>Same constraints</li>
            </ul>
            <p>...the output should be consistent. Not random, not surprising, not "creative" in ways you didn't ask for.</p>

            <h3>Continuous</h3>
            <p>Work should survive interruptions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Session crashes? Resume with <code>/start-work</code></li>
                <li>Need to step away? Progress is tracked</li>
                <li>Multi-day project? Context is preserved</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The agent maintains state. You don't have to.</p>

            <h3>Delegatable</h3>
            <p>Just like you can assign a task to a capable team member and trust them to handle it, you should be able to delegate to the agent.</p>
            <p>This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear acceptance criteria, verified independently</li>
                <li>Self-correcting behavior when something goes wrong</li>
                <li>Escalation (to Oracle, to user) only when truly needed</li>
                <li>Complete work, not "mostly done"</li>
            </ul>
